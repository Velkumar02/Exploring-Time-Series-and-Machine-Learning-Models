## Exploring Time Series and Machine Learning Model for Corporation Wastage in Tirunelveli.
In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on sustainable waste management practices in India.
Corporation wastage refers to the management and disposal of waste generated by municipal corporations or local governing bodies in Indian cities and towns.
This study aims to explore the best models for corporation wastage in Tirunelveli city. 
The data on generation of non-Biodegradable waste in Tirunelveli town has been collected from Tirunelveli corporation from July 2022 to February 2023.
In this study accurate predictions of waste generation are made using the, SARIMAX and XG-Boost. 
The performance of each model has been assessed using root mean squared error (RMSE) value.
# Data
The data were collected from the, ’Tirunelveli District Corporation Office’. The observation is based on a period of 243 days of day wise` data.

# Stationarity
A stationary time series is one whose statistical properties, such as mean, variance, and autocovariance, remain constant over time. 
In other words, it does not exhibit any systematic trends, cycles, or significant changes in statistical characteristics across different time periods

# Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analysing and summarizing data sets to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights. 
It involves examining and visualizing data to understand its main characteristics, identify trends, detect outliers, and formulate hypotheses for further analysis. 
EDA is often the first step in the data analysis process and helps researchers and data scientists gain a better understanding of the data before applying more advanced statistical techniques.
# Sarimax.
SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables) is an extension of the SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. SARIMA itself is an extension of the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. 
SARIMAX was developed to incorporate exogenous variables, allowing for better modeling of time series data.

# XGBoost.
XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting).It is a powerful and scalable implementation of the gradient boosting framework, which combines the predictions of multiple weak learners (decision trees) to create a strong predictive model.
